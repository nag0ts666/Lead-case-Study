# Lead-case-Study


Overview:-

X Education, an online course provider for professionals, aims to boost its 30% lead conversion rate. Visitors to their site become leads by filling out forms and the sales team contacts them to convert them into customers. So in order to improve the efficiency, X Education seeks to identify "Hot Leads" which are most likely to convert by using a logistic regression model to assign a lead score (0-100). Higher scores indicate a higher likelihood of conversion and the model should also adapt to future requirements as detailed in additional documents.
